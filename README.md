## BOOMERANG WEBSITE

To use git clone the repo, open up the folder and `npm install` then `npm run start:dev` to start the server  
It will live reload if you change  
Just commit when you have a change you want to share, we won't do pull requests or anything  

I will setup travis cli so that it auto builds to github pages so everyone can see how it is progressing without installing

## ðŸ›  Usage

- Write all your ES2015+ Javascript code in `src/js` and SCSS styling in `src/style`. Store static assets in `src/static`. Organize HTML files the way you like.
- Available commands:
  - `npm run build`: Build files to the `dist` folder. Transpiles down to ES5 and bundles all JS into `app.bundle.js`. Transpiles SCSS to CSS and adds prefixing into `style.bundle.css`. Copies static assets and HTML over, and bundled CSS and JS gets added to HTML file.
  - `npm run start:dev`: Run `webpack-dev-server` at `localhost:9000`. Includes live reloading on any Javascript/SCSS/HTML changes.
  - `npm run start`: Builds files and runs a local production server on `localhost:8080` with `http-server`.
  - `npm run run lint:js`: Lints JS with ESLint.
  - `npm run lint:styles`: Lints SCSS stylesheets with stylelint.
  - `npm run lint:html`: Lints HTML for a11y issues using pa11y.
  
## ðŸ”„ Continuous Integration

This boilerplate contains integration with [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/). The build system runs all linting scripts and deploys to GitHug pages upon push to the `master` branch. However, note that this deployment flow only works for Project Pages, as User and Organization pages [only support the master branch flow](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/).

For more information on how to set up alternative deployment processes, check out the [Travis CI documentation on deployment](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/deployment). The service can deploy to dozens of cloud providers, including Heroku, AWS, and Firebase.
